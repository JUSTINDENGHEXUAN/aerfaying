        in the wrong side of it whoa so this is a passenger aircraft right so we've. Got a, land and then gather some people
        let's see if we can't do that because oh my gosh it's very sensitive all right we're all getting in this helicopter
        you know we are all right, so then I want to be what is yeah that on this, side right whoa whoa what oh no way yes

        beam oh shoot enemy, sighted boys take him out check out the enemy helicopter they've only got it seems like only
        one crew there we go we shot him. Down first aerial kill of the day oh I guess he had a he had a hit a, co-pilot
        or navigator copilot but now we. Just need the Huey with the m60 s on the side well there's the bomber plane so we
        can give some aerial cover let's check the map real. Quick it's a it's a even 3v3 oh here we go hold on Oh reload

        oh we got a hit yes look at that. Woo boys what's up now oh as we kind of start flying sideways IV that oh oh wow
        we just almost flew into. The bunker system I'm still. Not the best helicopter pilot I think that goes without saying
        here we go a new opponent is into the battlefield I'm like trying to lead my shots but when. I'm leading too early
        are there people on the sides that there you go to aerial kills to our name boys let's rearm this thing and watch
        them as, deep as they fall to their doom look at that. The pilot and co-pilot just jumped out right before it exploded
        did they survive were there any survivors here oh can you mention trying to fly helicopters in, real life are any
        of you like pilots aircraft pilots helicopter pilots aircraft is in airplanes, any Zeppelin or dirigible pilots out
        there oh my gosh incoming rocket now this is the. One with the Hydra on it right so we can go out I was like what
        is that what is that aircraft noise it's an aircraft. Bad alright let's let's do let's do a wait is that mine it
        looks, like it could be a red flag er man they're really pushing in aren't they let's mess up this aerial car this
        ground column and then get out of. Dodge wolf what's up boys oh my gosh they're firing oh they're firing. Small arms
        at me from the ground there look at that everybody's firing rockets at me no way there's no way they did that man
        look. At look they're still firing I've never seen so many. Rockets being fired I mean like in Raven Field ever how
        many Rockets is dead we should get a rocket counter, from when we started like that's insane and then we just got
        hit again everybody has slammer rounds apparently all right boys everybody in the Huey oh, my god so this Huey Bell
        is made. By tinnitus and I tell you what tinnitus is always in my ear just bothering with Jesus out of. Me but look

        and they had some really really good helicopters in it. Oh look there's the enemy Huey I wonder if we could just
        use our side Gunners to take it out I'm gonna, try that we're so this is the first duel I've ever had in a helicopter
        where, I have not had offensive weaponry and I've had to rely on my friends now we're actually. In a dangerous area
        yeah and there's oh my god those Rockets are coming in we're gonna try to. Gain some elevation here and then come
        down if we're above them it should be harder for them to hit us hey. Guys how you doing boys yo oh my god I think
